# SapMachine Build Infrastructure

## Description

This repository contains tools, scripts and infrastructure required to build, test and maintain the [SapMachine project](https://github.com/SAP/SapMachine). 

The jobs run on our Jenkins installation https://sapmachine-ci.sapcloud.io/.

Mercurial repos are imported to branches **jdk/jdk** and **jdk/jdk10**.
Every few hours, we poll the upstream mercurial repositories and add new changes and tags ([*update-pipeline* on jenkins](https://sapmachine-ci.sapcloud.io/view/repository-update/job/update-pipeline/)).

The SapMachine Github Repository https://github.com/SAP/SapMachine is oranized into the following branches:

*  **jdk/jdk** and **jdk/jdk10** are mirrors of the corresponding mercurial repos.
* **sapmachine10**: **jdk/jdk10** + our changes.
* **sapmachine**: **jdk/jdk** + our changes.
* **sapmachine10-alpine**: **sapmachine10** + alpine changes.
* **sapmachine-alpine**: **sapmachine** + alpine changes.

We cherry-pick our changes between sapmachine and sapmachine10.
We merge **jdk/jdk10** and **jdk/jdk** with new build tags.
The job *check-tag-pipeline*, polls these branches for new tags, opens pull requests and starts validation jobs. 
Merge is triggered manually, after reviewing test and build results and resolving conflicts if needed.

Build-jobs run in docker containers to have a reproducible build environment.
Different build-jobs use the same Pipeline with different parameters.
Build jobs start test jobs. However, we don't use the result of the tests as indicator of a failure of the build job, as some failures have to be considered a *normal*. Some tests are shaky, other failure address open issues that will be fixed with the next build. However, we should compare our results to the results reported here: http://download.java.net/openjdk/testresults/10/testresults.html

## Requirements

### Jenkins Installation
We run the jobs on a jenkins installation with one master and two slaves.
As most of the jobs run in docker containers, docker must be installed on the slave machines.

### Access to SapMachine Repository
Some of the jobs need push access to the [Sapmachine repository](https://github.com/SAP/SapMachine). It is possible to work with a fork of this repository. The credentials have to be configured in Jenkis. 
 
## Installation
After installing jenkins, one pipelin job has to be configured that runs the Pipeline [jenkins-restore-pipeline](jenkins-restore-pipeline/Jenkinsfile). This jobs imports the whole jenkins configuration. After running this job, the configuration has to be reloaded.
To get all the jobs to function, missing credentials have to be added. Depending on the jenkins installation, some missing plugins have to be installed. 
If working with a forked SapMachine repository, the repository URL in most of the Jenkinsfiles has to be changed accordingly.
